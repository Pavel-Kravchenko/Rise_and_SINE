Pan-ZGA lists of different degrees can be found in the ```pan_ZGA_lists``` directory. Pan-ZGA list of the 1st degree is used in the work (```./Pan_ZGA_lists/Pan_1_degree_ZGA_genes.csv```).

Figure S1A. Venn diagram of ZGA list intersections grouped by mouse strain background. The core intersection consists of 200 ZGA genes. Overlaps comprising the pan-ZGA genes list of the 1st degree are indicated by white circles. The pan-ZGA genes list of the 1st degree consists of 542 genes (See Formula 1).

Formula 1. Selection of pan-ZGA genes. The union of the intersection of all individual ZGA gene lists in ùî∏={Z1, Z2, ‚Ä¶, Zn} with the union of intersections of all individual ZGA gene lists but one indexed as k, where k is every ZGA list from ùî∏. Pan-ZGA genes of 2, 3, ‚Ä¶, n-1 degree could be produced similarly, excluding 2, 3, ‚Ä¶, n-1 k datasets, respectively. The first argument of the intersection of all individual ZGA gene lists was isolated to introduce the core ZGA list explicitly.

Figure S1B. Pan-ZGA genes are partially controlled by orphan nuclear receptors (OrphNRs), OBOX and DUX. Pan-ZGA genes intersect with 85% of overlapped downregulated genes upon OrphNRs, OBOX or DUX perturbation, leaving 15% of genes regulated by currently unknown factors. The former category is comprised of 78% regulated by OrphNRs, 40% regulated by OBOX, and 4.6% regulated by DUX. OrphNRs and OBOX together regulate 34% of pan-ZGA genes.
